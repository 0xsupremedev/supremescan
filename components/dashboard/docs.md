Each has a simple colored icon: a code file, AI brain icon, alert symbol, network graph, and a report document.

Command Example Box

A terminal-style box showing a command:

$ supremescan scan —-contract 0x… —-chain ethereum

Footer Note Box

A blue “Note” box with a lightbulb icon.
The text appears slightly distorted or overlapping but says that SupremeScan is a sample command and explains vulnerability scanning across Ethereum/EVM chains.

If you want, I can rewrite it more concisely, create an alt-text, or produce a documentation paragraph for your product.
